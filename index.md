### [Project 1: Morse Code Emulator](https://www.arduino.cc/)

- Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
- Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
- It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages.

### [Project 2: Line Following Robot](https://www.arduino.cc/)

- Utilizing multiple infrared sensors to detect white and black colours
- Programming an Arduino to control 12V DC motors such that the central sensor is always on the black line
